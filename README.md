## Inspiration
Since summer is coming soon, a lot of people want to travel and find vacation package deals, we want to introduce Travelry, an app that sends vacation package deals and discounts to subscribed customers.

## What it does
Customers submit their email addresses and will receive email notifications from Travelry about different vacation package deals. 

## How we built it
We built our app using Courier SDK, API, Automation, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also use the data tracking and management tool in Courier to track the amount of emails that were successfully sent to our customers to verify valid customers' emails and develop plan for marketing strategies to reach wider audiences. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to learn new technologies of Courier. We had to read documents and learn to build. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to use different features of Courier to build our app

## What we learned
We learnt about Courier new technologies, how to send courier API, and use different functions of Courier.

## What's next for Travelry
We would like to expand and include bot in our app
